PREPARATIONS:
  
- create visualization working on expected index pattern (bp-*) and saved filters
  - export all objects to a json file
- reinstall kibana and send new data to new indices

DEPLOY KIBANA UI
- put ES index template
- create indices based on inserted template (for kibana index patterns)
  \-> this is most likely redundant, because api allows index pattern creation, despite missing indices. When indices are created the index pattern needs to be refreshed :)
- import all objects (json file from export)
