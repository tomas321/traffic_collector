A full installation guide for dependencies and the traffic_collector program.

##########################
## INSTALL dependencies ##
##########################

## yaml-cpp installation ##
Installation guide is in detail on 'https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp'.
Simple install on Unix/Linux like systems:
  1. Direct download or clone the repository.
  2. Locate to the repository root directory.
  3. 
     mkdir build && cd build
     cmake ..
     make
     make install


## rapidjson ##
Rapidjson is a header only library and it should be included in the lib/
directory. In scope of this program, there is no need for full installation.


## geoip-api-c ##
Intallation guide is in detail on 'https://github.com/maxmind/geoip-api-c'.
according to the installation guide the building requires GNU make utility.
Simple install on Unix/Linux like systems:
  1. Direct download or clone the repository.
  2. Locate to the repository root directory.
  3.
     ./bootstrap # dependent on autoreconf (autoconf, libtool, automake)

     gmake check
     gmake install

Via Ubuntu PPA:
  1. sudo add-apt-repository ppa:maxmind/ppa
  2. sudo apt update
  3. sudo apt install libgeoip1 libgeoip-dev geoip-bin


## netmap ##
Dependency for installation are the kernel source files which are passed as
configarion option --kernel-sources

Installation guide is in detail on 'https://github.com/luigirizzo/netmap'. The
process varies depending on machine NIC used for capturing. The list of
supported NIC drivers can be found in official repository. This is an example
for Intel 1Gb Adapter with e1000e driver:
  1. Direct download or clone the repository.
  2. cd path/to/netmap/LINUX
  3. 
    ./configure --no-ext-drivers --kernel-sources=/usr/src/linux-source-4.15.0 
                --drivers=e1000e
     make
     make install
  4. Disable multiple device offloadings:
      ethtool -K <device_name> tx off rx off gso off tso off gro off
  5. Disable pause frames:
      ethtool -A <device_name> autoneg off tx off rx off


## netmap-libpcap ##
Dependencies are flex and bison packages. If the configuration fails, pass
--without-flex --without-bison to configuration.

Full installation guide is in official repository 
'https://github.com/luigirizzo/netmap-libpcap/blob/master/INSTALL.txt'. 
Simple install on Unix/Linux like systems:
  1. Direct download or clone the repository.
  2. Locate to the repository root directory.
  3. 
     ./configure
     make
     make install (optional)
        - run 'make install' only if you want to replace your current libpcap.

## traffic_collector ##
After successfully installing the listed dependencies this is the main guide
to build traffic_collector on Unix/Linux like system to following dependecies
are required:
  - cmake
  - make
  - gcc
  - gmake -> for building geoip library
  - netlib -> gethostbyname

Installation process:
  1. Locate to the repository root directory.
  2. 
     mkdir build && cd build
     cmake ..
     make


## elk stack ##
Traffic_collector sends captured data to ELK stack infrastructure. Installation
guide in detailed is on the official elastic website
'https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack/current/installing-elastic-stack.html'.
Requirement is to install:
  - Filebeat
  - Logstash
  - Elasticsearch
  - Kibana
All components are configured with specific configuration files. To speed up
the use the ansible for elk stack deployment:
'https://github.com/tomas321/ansible-roles'

After installing ELK stack components to set up Kibana visualizations for
immediate network monitoring use the 'initialize_kibana.sh' script which
requires a direct connection to Kibana and Elasticsearch.

Possible problems:
  1. If the script was unable to connect, ensure the following passes:
    - nc -v <elastic.host> 9200
    - nc -v <kibana.host> 5601
